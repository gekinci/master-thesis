abstract = {Deep learning has started to have an impact on sports an-alytics. Several papers have applied action-value Q learning to quantify a team's chance of success, given the current match state. However, the black-box opacity of neural networks prohibits understanding why and when some actions are more valuable than others. This paper applies in-terpretable Mimic Learning to distill knowledge from the opaque neural net model to a transparent regression tree model. We apply Deep Reinforcement Learning to compute the Q function, and action impact under different game contexts, from 3M play-by-play events in the National Hockey League (NHL). The impact of an action is the change in Q-value due to the action. The play data along with the associated Q functions and impact are fitted by a mimic regression tree. We learn a general mimic regression tree for all players, and player-specific trees. The transparent tree structure facilitates understanding the general action values by feature influence and partial dependence plots, and player's exceptional characteristics by identifying player-specific relevant state regions.},

abstract = {DeepQB is a proposed application of deep neural networks to player tracking data from over two full seasons of American professional football. This novel approach demonstrates the ability to successfully understand complex aspects of the passing game, most notably quarterback decision-making. It can assess and compare individual quarterback pass target selection based on a snapshot presented to the passer by the receivers and defenders. Assessments of quarterback decision-making are made by comparing actual target selection to that predicted by our model. The model performs well, correctly identifying the targeted receiver in 60{\%} of cross-validated cases. When passers target the predicted receiver, passes are completed 74{\%} of the time, compared to 55{\%} when the QB targets any other receiver. This performance is surprisingly strong, given that the offense often conceals its intent by design, while defenses try not to allow any single receiver to be open. Further, quarterback passing skills separate and apart from his receivers and defense are isolated and assessed by comparing metrics of actual play success to the metrics of success predicted by the situation presented to the passer. This approach represents a new way for teams, media, and fans to understand and quantitatively assess quarterback decision-making, an aspect of the sport which has previously been opaque and inaccessible.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that deep neural networks are capable of approximating both value functions and policies in reinforcement learning domains featuring continuous state and action spaces. However, to the best of our knowledge no previous work has succeeded at using deep neural networks in structured (parameterized) continuous action spaces. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on learning within the domain of simulated RoboCup soccer, which features a small set of discrete action types, each of which is parameterized with continuous variables. The best learned agent can score goals more reliably than the 2012 RoboCup champion agent. As such, this paper represents a successful extension of deep reinforcement learning to the class of parameterized action space MDPs.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {During the 2017 NBA playoffs, Celtics coach Brad Stevens was faced with a difficult decision when defending against the Cavaliers: ``Do you double and risk giving up easy shots, or stay at home and do the best you can?"1 It's a tough call, but finding a good defensive strategy that effectively incorporates doubling can make all the difference in the NBA. In this paper, we analyze double teaming in the NBA, quantifying the trade-off between risk and reward. Using player trajectory data pertaining to over 643,000 possessions, we identified when the ball handler was double teamed. Given these data and the corresponding outcome (i.e., was the defense successful), we used deep reinforcement learning to estimate the quality of the defensive actions. We present qualitative and quantitative results summarizing our learned defensive strategy for defending. We show that our policy value estimates are predictive of points per possession and win percentage. Overall, the proposed framework represents a step toward a more comprehensive understanding of defensive strategies in the NBA. 1},

RL may profit significantly from world models (WMs) estimating state transition probabilities and rewards. In high-dimensional, continuous input spaces, however, learning accurate WMs is intractable. Here we show that incomplete WMs can help to quickly find good action selection policies. Our approach is based on a novel combination of CMACs and prioritized sweeping-like algorithms. Variants thereof outperform both Q(lambda)-learning with CMACs and the evolutionary method Probabilistic Incremental Program Evolution (PIPE) which performed best in previous comparisons.},

@article{Cervone2012,
abstract = {Basketball is a game of decisions; at any moment, a player can change the character of a possession by choosing to pass, dribble, or shoot. The current state of basketball analytics, however, provides no way to quantitatively evaluate the vast majority of decisions that players make, as most metrics are driven by events that occur at or near the end of a possession, such as points, turnovers, and assists. We propose a framework for using plater-tracking data to assign a point value to each moment of a possession by computing how many points the offense is expected to score by the end of the possession, a quantity we call expected possession value (EPV). EPV allows analysts to evaluate every decision made during a basketball game - whether it is to pass, dribble, or shoot - opening the door for a multitude of new metrics and analyses of basketball that quantify value in terms of points. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for estimating EPV, present results of EPV computations performed using player-tracking data from the 2012-2013 season, adn provide several examples of EPV-derived metrics that answer real basketball questions.},

abstract = {Although the collection of player and ball tracking data is fast becoming the norm in professional sports, large-scale mining of such spatiotemporal data has yet to surface. In this paper, given an entire season's worth of player and ball tracking data from a professional soccer league (≈400,000,000 data points), we present a method which can conduct both individual player and team analysis. Due to the dynamic, continuous and multi-player nature of team sports like soccer, a major issue is aligning player positions over time. We present a "role-based" representation that dynamically updates each player's relative role at each frame and demonstrate how this captures the short-term context to enable both individual player and team analysis. We discover role directly from data by utilizing a minimum entropy data partitioning method and show how this can be used to accurately detect and visualize formations, as well as analyze individual player behavior.},

@article{Rematas2016,
abstract = {Intercepting the GPU calls between the video game engine and the graphics card using RenderDoc [1] usually results in a massive amount of information, from texture and depth buffers to blend shape weights of the participating human models. While it is easy to locate and extract the color/depth buffers, the other information is more difficult to parse. For example, the naming of the intercepted variables is not always meaningful and in order to use them more sophisticated methods are needed [4]. In our case, the area of action (soccer field) has specific dimensions and structure that can be used to infer information such as camera matrices. In particular, our goal is to estimate the video game camera modelview matrix M mv and projection matrix M proj (OpenGL/DirectX), so we can invert the depth buffer that it is in Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC). Below (Appendix A) we describe the method to recover these matrices. The additional information that we need is a) a person segmentation of the texture buffer and b) an auxiliary camera that observes the field in world coordinates. To find which pixels belong to the players we use the semantic segmentation network of [7]. Then, for the auxiliary camera we follow the same approach as in Sec. 4.1: we estimate a camera with parameters M aux that observes the soccer field that lies in the world center with y axis 0. Note that the intrinsics and extrinsics of the auxiliary camera cannot be used directly for estimating M proj and M mv , since they do not include the near/far plane parameters and we do not know the video game's world system. Appendix A. Estimating Video Game Cameras To estimate the camera parameters (modelview and projection matrices) of a video game image, we need its corresponding NDC buffer, the auxiliary camera M aux that observes the field and the player segmentation mask. The modelview and projection matrices in OpenGL/DirectX are 4 × 4 and the parameters to be estimated are the rotation vector $\theta$ x , theta y , theta z , the translation vector t x , t y , t z and focal length, near and far plane f, z near , z far. Essentially we want to find the parameters that transformed the world scene to NDC so we can invert them: x clip y clip z clip w clip = M proj M mv x world y world z world 1 (1) xNDC yNDC zNDC = x clip /w clip y clip /w clip z clip /w clip (2) To estimate the OpenGL cameras we can rely on the structure of the scene: points that belong to the soccer field (and not to players) should lie on a plane with y equals to 0. The 3D world position of the ground pixels can be found by intersecting the rays from the auxiliary camera's ground pixels towards the ground. However, if we optimize only for the ground pixels, the z near , z far parameters collapse, resulting in wrong reconstructions for the players. In addition to the ground constraint, we can minimize the reprojection error of the player 3D points to the auxiliary camera. Therefore, for a sets of world 3D points X p with p ∈ ground and a set of 2D points (pixel location) y q with q ∈ player, the modelview matrix M mv and the projection matrix M proj are found by minimizing: min p∈ground (||X p − ˆ X p || 2) + $\lambda$ q∈player (||y q − ˆ y q || 2) (3) withˆX withˆ withˆX p = M −1 mv M −1 proj X NDC p , ˆ y q = M aux M −1 mv M −1 proj X NDC q X NDC p and X NDC q correspond to the NDC coordinates of ground points p and player points q. The NDC coordinates are found by dividing the the x and y pixel locations with image width and height respectively; the z coordinate is the value of the depth buffer at the specific pixel location. The weight $\lambda$ was set to 0.01. Appendix B. Implementation Details Training Data Our training data comes from the video game Electronic Arts FIFA 2016. The GPU calls between the game engine and the graphics card were obtained using RenderDoc v0.34. The playing teams were randomly selected and the camera was set to broadcast.},

abstract = {Team sports such as ice hockey and basketball involve complex player interactions. Modeling how players interact with each other presents a great challenge to researchers in the eield of sports analysis. The most common source of data available for this type of analysis is player trajectory tracking data, which encode vital information about the motion, action, and intention of players. At an individual level, each player exhibits a characteristic trajectory style that can distinguish him from other players. At a team level, a set of player trajectories forms unique dynamics that differentiate the team from others. We believe both players and teams possess their own particular spatio-temporal patterns hidden in the trajectory data and we propose a generic deep learning model that learns powerful representations from player trajectories. We show the effectiveness of our approach on event recognition and team classiiication.},
