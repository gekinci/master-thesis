@book{MacKay2014,
abstract = {The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the preferred format for addressing the interoperability issues in using Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the information-intensive construction industry. IFC specifies virtual representation of building objects as well as their attributes and relationships. Although IFC is an open standard, its complex nature makes information retrieval from an IFC model difficult. This paper proposes an ontology built with Web Ontology Language (OWL) based on IFC specifications to help the information retrieval process from an IFC model. With simple reasoning build into the ontology, an information retrieval system could query the IFC model in XML format directly. The development of the ontology is reviewed and test cases are designed to validate the ontology. Limitations and future studies are also discussed at the end.},

@misc{Kampen2007,
abstract = {The third edition of Van Kampen's standard work has been revised and updated. The main difference with the second edition is that the contrived application of the quantum master equation in section 6 of chapter XVII has been replaced with a satisfactory treatment of quantum fluctuations. Apart from that throughout the text corrections have been made and a number of references to later developments have been included. From the recent textbooks the following are the most relevant. C.W.Gardiner, Quantum Optics (Springer, Berlin 1991) D.T. Gillespie, Markov Processes (Academic Press, San Diego 1992) W.T. Coffey, Yu.P.Kalmykov, and J.T.Waldron, The Langevin Equation (2nd edition, World Scientific, 2004) * Comprehensive coverage of fluctuations and stochastic methods for describing them * A must for students and researchers in applied mathematics, physics and physical chemistry. {\textcopyright} {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.
