abstract = {Stochasticity pervades life at the cellular level. Cells receive stochastic signals, perform detection and transduction with stochastic biochemistry, and grow and die in stochastic environments. Here we review progress in going from the molecular details to the information-processing strategies cells use in their decision-making. Such strategies are fundamentally influenced by stochasticity. We argue that the cellular decision-making can only be probabilistic and occurs at three levels. First, cells must infer from noisy signals the probable current and anticipated future state of their environment. Second, they must weigh the costs and benefits of each potential response, given that future. Third, cells must decide in the presence of other, potentially competitive, decision-makers. In this context, we discuss cooperative responses where some individuals can appear to sacrifice for the common good. We believe that decision-making strategies will be conserved, with comparatively few strategies being implemented by different biochemical mechanisms in many organisms. Determining the strategy of a decision-making network provides a potentially powerful coarse-graining that links systems and evolutionary biology to understand biological design. {\textcopyright} 2009 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Kaelbling2011,
abstract = {The aim of this work is to analyze and compare several feature extraction methods for peptide classification that are based on the calculation of texture descriptors starting from a matrix representation of the peptide. This texture-based representation of the peptide is then used to train a support vector machine classifier. In our experiments, the best results are obtained using local binary patterns variants and the discrete cosine transform with selected coefficients. These results are better than those previously reported that employed texture descriptors for peptide representation. In addition, we perform experiments that combine standard approaches based on amino acid sequence. The experimental section reports several tests performed on a vaccine dataset for the prediction of peptides that bind human leukocyte antigens and on a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Experimental results confirm the usefulness of our novel descriptors. The matlab implementation of our approaches is available at http://bias.csr.unibo.it/nanni/TexturePeptide.zip . {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A nonhomogeneous Markov process is applied for analysing a cohort of women with breast cancer that were submitted to surgery. The follow-up was scheduled every month. Three states are considered: no relapse, relapse and death. As relapse times change over time, we have extended previous approaches for a time-homogeneous model to a nonhomogeneous multistate process. The transition intensity functions among states are the hazard rate functions of different lognormal distributions; we therefore build the likelihood function for this model, estimate the parameters and compare the empirical and nonhomogeneous models in terms of the survival probability functions. The parameter estimation is done following the maximum likelihood method. The effect of treatments is incorporated as covariates by means of the lognormal hazard rate functions, following the proportional hazard model. Thus, we have a multistate model with multidimensional covariates. Survival functions for the different cohorts submitted to treatments are obtained and goodness-of-fit tests are performed.},

@article{Bowsher2014,
abstract = {The recognition that gene expression can be substantially stochastic poses the question of how cells respond to dynamic environments using biochemistry that itself fluctuates. The study of cellular decision-making aims to solve this puzzle by focusing on quantitative understanding of the variation seen across isogenic populations in response to extracellular change. This behaviour is complex, and a theoretical framework within which to embed experimental results is needed. Here we review current approaches, with an emphasis on information theory, sequential data processing, and optimality arguments. We conclude by highlighting some limitations of these techniques and the importance of connecting both theory and experiment to measures of fitness. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Gkigkitzis2013,
abstract = {Background: The aim of this report is to provide a mathematical model of the mechanism for making binary fate decisions about cell death or survival, during and after Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) treatment, and to supply the logical design for this decision mechanism as an application of rate distortion theory to the biochemical processing of information by the physical system of a cell. Methods. Based on system biology models of the molecular interactions involved in the PDT processes previously established, and regarding a cellular decision-making system as a noisy communication channel, we use rate distortion theory to design a time dependent Blahut-Arimoto algorithm where the input is a stimulus vector composed of the time dependent concentrations of three PDT related cell death signaling molecules and the output is a cell fate decision. The molecular concentrations are determined by a group of rate equations. The basic steps are: initialize the probability of the cell fate decision, compute the conditional probability distribution that minimizes the mutual information between input and output, compute the cell probability of cell fate decision that minimizes the mutual information and repeat the last two steps until the probabilities converge. Advance to the next discrete time point and repeat the process. Results: Based on the model from communication theory described in this work, and assuming that the activation of the death signal processing occurs when any of the molecular stimulants increases higher than a predefined threshold (50{\%} of the maximum concentrations), for 1800s of treatment, the cell undergoes necrosis within the first 30 minutes with probability range 90.0{\%}-99.99{\%} and in the case of repair/survival, it goes through apoptosis within 3-4 hours with probability range 90.00{\%}-99.00{\%}. Although, there is no experimental validation of the model at this moment, it reproduces some patterns of survival ratios of predicted experimental data. Conclusions: Analytical modeling based on cell death signaling molecules has been shown to be an independent and useful tool for prediction of cell surviving response to PDT. The model can be adjusted to provide important insights for cellular response to other treatments such as hyperthermia, and diseases such as neurodegeneration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gkigkitzis; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell communication networks have critical roles in coordinating diverse organismal processes, such as tissue development or immune cell response. However, compared with intracellular signal transduction networks, the function and engineering principles of cell-to-cell communication networks are far less understood. Major complications include: cells are themselves regulated by complex intracellular signaling networks; individual cells are heterogeneous; and output of any one cell can recursively become an additional input signal to other cells. Here, we make use of a framework that treats intracellular signal transduction networks as “black boxes” with characterized input-to-output response relationships. We study simple cell-to-cell communication circuit motifs and find conditions that generate bimodal responses in time, as well as mechanisms for independently controlling synchronization and delay of cell-population responses. We apply our modeling approach to explain otherwise puzzling data on cytokine secretion onset times in T cells. Our approach can be used to predict communication network structure using experimentally accessible input-to-output measurements and without detailed knowledge of intermediate steps. Interacting cellular communities have critical roles in biological functions such as tissue development or immune responses. Cell-to-cell communication networks comprise both intra- and intercellular processes, making detailed mathematical models intractable. Here, we develop a scalable framework for modeling extra-cellular communication networks that treats intracellular signal transduction networks as “black boxes” with characterized input-to-output response relationships. We discover that a range of dynamic cell-population behaviors, including cellular synchronization, delays, and bimodal responses, can emerge from simple cell-to-cell communication networks.},

@article{Kobayashi2010a,
abstract = {Decision making in a noisy and dynamically changing environment is a fundamental task for a cell. To choose appropriate decisions over time, a cell must be equipped with intracellular kinetics that can conduct dynamic and efficient decision making. By using the theory of sequential inference, I demonstrate that dynamic Bayesian decision making can be implemented by an intracellular kinetics with a dual positive feedback structure. I also show that the combination of linear instantaneous and nonlinear stationary sensitivities to the input dominantly contributes to decision making efficiency, and that the state-dependent sensitivity change further suppresses noisy response. The statistical principles underlying these two factors are further clarified to be a log-likelihood-dependent quantification of the input information and uncertainty-dependent sensitivity control. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

@article{Paarporn2018a,
abstract = {Collective action dilemmas pervade the social and biological sciences - from human decision-making to bacterial quorum sensing. In these scenarios, individuals sense cues from the environment to adopt a suitable phenotype or change in behavior. However, when cues include signals from other individuals, then the appropriate behavior of each individual is linked. Here, we develop a framework to quantify the influence of information sharing on individual behavior in the context of two player coordination games. In this framework, the environment stochastically switches between two states, and the state determines which one of two actions players must coordinate on. Given a stochastically switching environment, we then consider two versions of the game that differ in the way players acquire information. In the first model, players independently sense private environmental cues, but do not communicate with each other. We find there are two types of strategies that emerge as Nash equilibria and fitness maximizers - players prefer to commit to one particular action when private information is poor, or prefer to employ phenotypic plasticity when it is good. The second model adds an additional layer of communication, where players share social cues as well. When the quality of social information is high, we find the socially optimal strategy is a novel “majority logic” strategy that bases decision-making on social cues. Our game-theoretic approach offers a principled way of investigating the role of communication in group decision-making under uncertain conditions.},
